# Connect4CSharp

This is an implementation of the game connect 4 in C# using windows forms.

It also includes the ability to save and load a game to/from a binary file.

All the code is in the Connect4CSharp folder.

I created and tested it using Jetbrains's Rider IDE (same people that make intellij, just their C# IDE) but it should work fine with Microsoft's Visual Studio. Working Binaries are avaliable under the release section of this Github repo.
